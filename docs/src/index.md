# CalculatedABC.jl

A Julia port of the [ABCanalysis R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ABCanalysis/).

---

For a given data set, the package provides a novel method of computing
precise limits to acquire subsets which are easily interpreted. Closely
related to the Lorenz curve, the ABC curve visualizes the data by
graphically representing the cumulative distribution function. Based on
an ABC analysis the algorithm calculates, with the help of the ABC curve,
the optimal limits by exploiting the mathematical properties pertaining
to distribution of analyzed items. The data containing positive values is
divided into three disjoint subsets A, B and C, with subset A comprising
very profitable values, i.e. largest data values ("the important few"),
subset B comprising values where the yield equals to the effort required
to obtain it, and the subset C comprising of non-profitable values,
i.e., the smallest data sets ("the trivial many").
